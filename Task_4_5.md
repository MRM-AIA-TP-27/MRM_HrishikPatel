# Task 4 & 5: Branching, Documentation, and Merging\n\nThis set of tasks demonstrated the workflow for creating a feature branch (`Temp`), making isolated changes (adding `Task_3.md`), and then integrating those changes back into the primary development line (`main`) using a merge.\n\n### Git Commands Used (Task 4: Branching and Pushing):\n\n1.  **`git checkout -b Temp`**: Created a new branch named `Temp` and immediately switched the working directory to this new branch.\n2.  **`touch Task_3.md` or creating the file using echo**: Created the documentation file required for Task 3.\n3.  **`git add Task_3.md`**: Staged the new file.\n4.  **`git commit -m "Task 4: Added Task_3.md documentation"`**: Committed the file to the `Temp` branch.\n5.  **`git push -u origin Temp`**: Pushed the new `Temp` branch to the remote repository for the first time.\n\n### Git Commands Used (Task 5: Merging and Finalizing):\n\n1.  **`git checkout main`**: Switched back to the `main` branch, preparing it for the merge.\n2.  **`git merge Temp`**: Integrated the changes from the `Temp` branch into the current `main` branch (a fast-forward merge).\n3.  **`touch Task_4_5.md` or creating the file using echo**: Created the final documentation file for this task.\n4.  **`git add Task_4_5.md`**: Staged the new file.\n5.  **`git commit -m "Task 5: Merged Temp branch and added Task_4_5.md"`**: Committed the merge result and the new documentation file.\n6.  **`git push`**: Pushed the updated `main` branch, including the merged content and the new documentation, to GitHub.
